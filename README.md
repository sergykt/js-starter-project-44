# About

Hi! I am Sergei Sivtsev. This is my first study project from Hexlet :)

The project is a set of five console games based on popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again.

# Install

Clone this pepository and use command:
```bash
npm link
```

# List of games

```bash
brain-games - just a greeting
brain-even - even test
brain-calc - calculator
brain-gcd - greatest common divisor
brain-progression - guess the number from the progression

```
